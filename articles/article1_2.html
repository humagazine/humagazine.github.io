<p class="big-first-letter">I met Chris in my first month at a small, hard-partying Catholic high school in north-eastern <span id="mention-3" class="mention place" about="Wisconsin" data-label="Wisconsin" data-wikidata-id="Q1537">Wisconsin</span>, where kids jammed cigarettes between the fingers of the school’s lifesize Jesus statue and skipped mass to eat fries at the fast-food joint across the street. Chris and her circle perched somewhere adjacent to the school’s <span class="keyword" id="keyword-2" about="society" data-label="society" data-sort="society">social</span> hierarchy, and she surveyed the adolescent drama and absurdity with cool, heavy-lidded understanding. I admired her from afar and shuffled around the edges of her orbit, gleeful whenever she motioned for me to join her gang for lunch.</p>

<p>After high school, we lost touch. I went east; Chris stayed in the midwest. To pay for school at the <span class="mention organization" id="mention-4" about="University of Minnesota" data-wikidata-id="Q238101" data-label="University of Minnesota">University of Minnesota</span>, she hawked costume jewellery at <span id="mention-5" class="mention place" about="Dayton" data-label="Dayton" data-wikidata-id="Q34739">Dayton</span>’s department store. She got married to a tall classmate named Adam and merged with the mainstream – became a lawyer, had a couple of daughters. She would go running at the <span class="mention organization" id="mention-6" about="World YWCA" data-wikidata-id="Q643370" data-label="World YWCA"><span class="wmf-wp-with-preview" data-wikipedia-preview>YWCA</span></span> and cook oatmeal for breakfast. Then in 2010, at the age of 35, she went to the ER with stomach pains. She struggled to describe the pain – it wasn’t like anything she’d felt before. The doctor told her it was indigestion and sent her home. But the symptoms kept coming back. She was strangely tired and constipated. She returned to the doctor. She didn’t feel right, she said. Of course you’re tired, he told her, you’re raising kids. You’re stressed. You should be tired. Frustrated, she saw other  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-3" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">doctors</span>. You’re a working mom, they said. You need to relax. Add fibre to your diet. The problems ratcheted up in frequency. She was anaemic, and always so tired. She’d feel sleepy when having coffee with a friend. Get some rest, she was told. Try sleeping pills.</p>

<p>By 2012, the fatigue was so overwhelming, Chris couldn’t walk around the block. She’d fall asleep at three in the afternoon. Her skin was turning pale. She felt pain when she ate. Adam suggested she see his childhood physician, who practised 40 minutes away. That  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-4" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">doctor</span> tested her blood. Her iron was so low, he thought she was bleeding internally. He scheduled a CT scan and a colonoscopy. When they revealed a golf ball-sized tumour, Chris felt, for a moment, relieved. She was sick. She’d been telling them all along. Now there was a specific problem to solve. But the relief was short-lived. Surgery six days later showed that the tumour had spread into her abdomen. At the age of 37, Chris had stage four colon cancer.</p>

<p>Historically, <span class="keyword" id="keyword-5" about="research" data-label="research" data-sort="research">research</span> about the roots of  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-6" about="health" data-label="health" data-sort="health">health</span> disparities – differences in  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-7" about="health" data-label="health" data-sort="health">health</span> and disease among different <span class="keyword" id="keyword-8" about="society" data-label="society" data-sort="society">social</span> groups – has sought answers in the patients: their behaviour, their status, their circumstances. Perhaps, the thinking went, some patients wait longer to seek help in the first place, or they don’t comply with  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-9" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">doctors</span>’ orders.</p>

<p>Maybe patients receive fewer interventions because that’s what they prefer. For Black Americans,  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-10" about="health" data-label="health" data-sort="health">health</span> disparities have long been seen as originating in the bodies of the patients, a notion promoted by the racism of the 19th-century medical field. Medical journals published countless articles detailing invented physiological flaws of Black Americans; statistics pointing to increased mortality rates in the late 19th century were seen as evidence not of <span class="keyword" id="keyword-11" about="society" data-label="society" data-sort="society">social</span> and economic oppression and exclusion, but of physical inferiority.</p>

<p>In this century, <span class="keyword" id="keyword-12" about="research" data-label="research" data-sort="research">research</span> has increasingly focused on the <span class="keyword" id="keyword-13" about="society" data-label="society" data-sort="society">social</span> and environmental determinants of  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-14" about="health" data-label="health" data-sort="health">health</span>, including the way differences in access to insurance and care also change  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-15" about="health" data-label="health" data-sort="health">health</span> outcomes. The devastating disparate impact of <span class="wmf-wp-with-preview" data-wikipedia-preview>Covid-19</span> on communities of colour vividly illuminates these factors: the disproportionate burden can be traced to a web of <span class="keyword" id="keyword-16" about="society" data-label="society" data-sort="society">social</span> inequities, including more dangerous working conditions, lack of access to essential resources, and chronic  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-17" about="health" data-label="health" data-sort="health">health</span> conditions stemming from ongoing exposure to inequality, racism, exclusion and pollution. For trans people, particularly trans women of colour, the burden of disease is enormous. Trans individuals, whose marginalisation results in high rates of poverty, workplace discrimination, unemployment, and serious psychological distress, face much higher rates of chronic conditions such as asthma, chronic pulmonary obstructive disorder, depression and <span class="wmf-wp-with-preview" data-wikipedia-preview>HIV</span> than the <span class="wmf-wp-with-preview" data-wikipedia-preview>cisgender</span> population. A 2015 survey of nearly 28,000 trans individuals in the US found that one-third had not sought necessary  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-18" about="health" data-label="health" data-sort="health">healthcare</span> because they could not afford it.</p>

<p>More recently, <span class="keyword" id="keyword-19" about="research" data-label="research" data-sort="research">researchers</span> have also begun looking at differences that originate in the providers – differences in how  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-20" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">doctors</span> and other  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-21" about="health" data-label="health" data-sort="health">healthcare</span> professionals treat patients. And study after study shows that they treat some groups differently from others.</p>

<p>Black patients, for instance, are less likely than white patients to receive pain medication for the same symptoms, a pattern of disparate treatment that holds even for children. <span class="keyword" id="keyword-22" about="research" data-label="research" data-sort="research">Researchers</span> attribute this finding to false stereotypes that Black people don’t feel pain to the same degree as white people – stereotypes that date back to <span class="wmf-wp-with-preview" data-wikipedia-preview>chattel slavery</span> and were used to justify inhumane treatment. The problem pervades medical education, where “race” is presented as a risk factor for myriad diseases, rather than the accumulation of stressors linked to racism. Black immigrants from the Caribbean, for instance, have lower rates of hypertension and cardiovascular disease than US-born Black people, but after a couple of decades, their rates of illness increase toward those of the US-born Black population, a result generally attributed to the particular racism they encounter in the US.</p>

<p>Black patients are also given fewer therapeutic procedures, even when studies control for insurance, illness severity and type of <span class="keyword" id="keyword-23" about="hospital" data-label="hospital" data-sort="hospital">hospital</span>. For heart attacks, black people are less likely to receive guideline-based care; in intensive care units for heart failure, they are less likely to see a cardiologist, which is linked to survival.</p>

<p>These biases affect the quality of many other interactions in clinics.  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-24" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">Doctors</span> spend less time and build less emotional rapport with obese patients. Transgender people face overt prejudice and discrimination. The 2015 survey also found that in the preceding year, a third of respondents had had a negative encounter with a  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-25" about="health" data-label="health" data-sort="health">healthcare</span> provider, including being refused treatment. Almost a quarter were so concerned about mistreatment that they avoided necessary  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-26" about="health" data-label="health" data-sort="health">healthcare</span>. Transgender individuals can therefore face a dangerous choice: disclose their status as trans and risk discrimination, or conceal it and risk inappropriate treatment.</p>

<p>Even though medical providers are not generally intending to provide better treatment to some people at the expense of others, unexamined bias can create devastating harm.</p>

<hr/>

<p class="big-first-letter">Chris was told that her symptoms, increasingly unmanageable, were not serious. Women as a group receive fewer and less timely interventions, receive less pain treatment and are less frequently referred to specialists. One 2008 study of nearly 80,000 patients in more than 400 <span class="keyword" id="keyword-27" about="hospital" data-label="hospital" data-sort="hospital">hospitals</span> found that women having heart attacks experience dangerous treatment delays, and that once in the <span class="keyword" id="keyword-28" about="hospital" data-label="hospital" data-sort="hospital">hospital</span> they more often die. After a heart attack, women are less likely to be referred to cardiac rehabilitation or to be prescribed the right medication. Critically ill women older than 50 are less likely to receive life-saving interventions than men of the same age; women who have knee pain are 22 times less likely to be referred for a knee replacement than a man. A 2007 Canadian study of nearly 500,000 patients showed that after adjusting for the severity of illness, women spent a shorter time in the ICU and were less likely to receive life support; after age 50, they were also significantly more likely to die after a critical illness.</p>

<p>Women of colour are at particular risk for poor treatment. A 2019 analysis of their childbirth experiences found that they frequently encountered condescending, ineffective communication and disrespect from providers; some women felt bullied into having <span class="wmf-wp-with-preview" data-wikipedia-preview>C-sections</span>. <span id="mention-7" class="mention person" about="Serena Williams" data-label="Serena Williams" data-sort="WilliamsSerena" data-wikidata-id="Q11459">Serena Williams</span>’s childbirth story is by now well known: the tennis star has a history of blood clots, but when she recognised the symptoms and asked for immediate scans and treatment, the nurse and the  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-29" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">doctor</span> doubted her. <span id="mention-8" class="mention person" about="Serena Williams" data-label="Serena Williams" data-sort="WilliamsSerena" data-wikidata-id="Q11459">Williams</span> finally got what she needed, but ignoring women’s symptoms and distress contributes to higher maternal mortality rates among Black, Alaska Native and Native American women. Indeed, Black women alone in the <span id="mention-9" class="mention place" about="United States of America" data-label="United States of America" data-wikidata-id="Q30">US</span> are three to four times more likely to die of complications from childbirth than white women.</p>

<p>There’s also a structural reason for inferior care: women have historically been excluded from much of medical <span class="keyword" id="keyword-30" about="research" data-label="research" data-sort="research">research</span>. The reasons are varied, ranging from a desire to protect childbearing women from drugs that could impair foetal development, via notions that women’s hormones could complicate <span class="keyword" id="keyword-31" about="research" data-label="research" data-sort="research">research</span>, to an implicit judgment that men’s lives were simply more worth saving. Many landmark studies on ageing and heart disease never included women; the all-men study of cardiovascular disease named MRFIT emerged from a mindset that male breadwinners having heart attacks was a national emergency, even though cardiovascular disease is also the leading cause of death for women. In one particularly egregious example, a 1980s study examining the effect of obesity on breast cancer and uterine cancer excluded women because men’s hormones were "simpler" and "cheaper" to study.</p>

<p>Basic to these practices was an operating assumption that men were the default humans, of which women were a subcategory that could safely be left out of studies. Of course, there’s a logical problem here: the assertion is that women are so complicated and different that they can’t be included in <span class="keyword" id="keyword-32" about="research" data-label="research" data-sort="research">research</span>, and yet also so similar that any findings should seamlessly extend to them. In the 90s, the US Congress insisted that medical studies funded by the <span class="mention organization" id="mention-10" about="National Institutes of Health" data-label="National Institutes of Health" data-sort="NationalInstitutesofHealth"><span class="wmf-wp-with-preview" data-wikipedia-preview>National Institutes of  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-33" about="health" data-label="health" data-sort="health">Health</span></span></span> should include women; earlier, many drug studies also left out women, an exclusion that may help explain why women are 50%-75% more likely to experience adverse side-effects from drugs.</p>

<p>As the sociologist <span id="mention-11" class="mention person" about="Steven Epstein" data-label="Steven Epstein" data-sort="EpsteinSteven">Steven Epstein</span> points out, medicine often starts with categories that are <span class="keyword" id="keyword-34" about="society" data-label="society" data-sort="society">socially</span> and politically relevant – but these are not always medically relevant. Relying on categories such as race risks erasing the <span class="keyword" id="keyword-35" about="society" data-label="society" data-sort="society">social</span> causes of  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-36" about="health" data-label="health" data-sort="health">health</span> disparities and may entrench the false and damaging ideas that are inscribed in medical practice. At the same time, ignoring differences such as sex is perilous: as a result of their exclusion, women’s symptoms have not been medically well understood.  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-37" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">Doctors</span> were told, for example, that women present with "atypical symptoms" of heart attacks. In fact, these "atypical" symptoms are typical – for women. They were only "atypical" because they hadn’t been studied. Women and men also vary in their susceptibility to different diseases, and in the course and symptoms of those diseases. They respond to some drugs differently. Women’s kidneys filter waste more slowly, so some medications take longer to clear from the body.</p>

<p>This dearth of knowledge about women’s bodies has led  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-38" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">doctors</span> to see differences where none exist, and fail to see differences where they do. As the journalist <span id="mention-12" class="mention person" about="Maya Dusenbery" data-label="Maya Dusenbery" data-sort="DusenberyMaya">Maya Dusenbery</span> argues in her book Doing Harm, this ignorance also interacts perniciously with historical stereotypes.</p>

<p>When women’s understudied symptoms don’t match the textbooks,  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-39" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">doctors</span> label them "medically unexplained". These symptoms may then be classified as psychological rather than physical in origin. The fact that so many of women’s symptoms are "medically unexplained" reinforces the stereotype that women’s symptoms are overreactions without a medical basis, and casts doubt over all women’s narratives of their own experiences. One study found that while men who have irritable bowel syndrome are more likely to receive scans, women tend to be offered tranquilisers and lifestyle advice. In response to her pain and fatigue, my friend Chris was told she should get some sleep.</p>

<hr/>

<p class="big-first-letter">The  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-40" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">doctor</span> who finally ordered the right tests for Chris told her that he’d seen many young women in his practice whose diagnoses had been delayed because their symptoms were attributed to stress. Indeed, studies show that women around the world experience delays in receiving a correct diagnosis for many diseases, including <span class="wmf-wp-with-preview" data-wikipedia-preview data-wp-title="Crohn's disease">Crohn’s</span>, <span class="wmf-wp-with-preview" data-wikipedia-preview>Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</span>, coeliac disease and tuberculosis. A 2015 UK study of more than 16,000 patients also found delayed diagnoses for many types of cancer – bladder, gastric, head and neck, and lung cancer, and lymphoma, for instance. As <span id="mention-13" class="mention person" about="Maya Dusenbery" data-label="Maya Dusenbery" data-sort="DusenberyMaya">Dusenbery</span> argues, the problem is exacerbated by the fact that  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-41" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">doctors</span> rarely receive feedback about their misdiagnoses. They never learn where they went wrong.</p>

<p>Diagnostic errors, it is estimated, cause 80,000 deaths a year in the <span id="mention-14" class="mention place" about="United States of America" data-label="United States of America" data-wikidata-id="Q30">US</span>. Cognitive factors are estimated to play a role in 75% of these cases. What could have been done in Chris’s case? Certainly, it’s essential that  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-42" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">doctors</span> increase their awareness of their own capacity for biased decisions, and their motivation to overcome it. We know that biases are more likely to arise when people are mentally taxed. Meaningful, collaborative contact with those in other <span class="keyword" id="keyword-43" about="society" data-label="society" data-sort="society">social</span> groups can also help. But there’s another approach to reducing bias that can support all these efforts, providing another layer of protection against the risk of interpersonal bias.</p>

<p><span id="mention-15" class="mention person" about="Elliott Haut" data-label="Elliott Haut" data-sort="HautElliott">Elliott Haut</span> is a trauma surgeon at <span class="mention organization" id="mention-16" about="Johns Hopkins Hospital" data-wikidata-id="Q1472068" data-label="Johns Hopkins Hospital">Johns Hopkins <span class="keyword" id="keyword-44" about="hospital" data-label="hospital" data-sort="hospital">hospital</span></span> in <span id="mention-17" class="mention place" about="Baltimore" data-label="Baltimore" data-wikidata-id="Q5092">Baltimore</span>. Affable and baby-faced, he looks happiest when talking about safety. The desk in his office is scattered with books about preventable deaths. A note taped over his computer reads "reduce system errors".</p>

<p>In other parts of the country, the trauma unit might see farm accidents or motorcycle crashes. At <span class="mention organization" id="mention-18" about="Johns Hopkins Hospital" data-wikidata-id="Q1472068" data-label="Johns Hopkins Hospital">Hopkins</span>, many trauma patients are victims of gunshots or stabbings. One patient arrived with the shard of a beer bottle still lodged in his neck, the entire word "Budweiser" perfectly legible along the length of jagged glass.</p>

<p>About 15 years ago, <span id="mention-19" class="mention person" about="Elliott Haut" data-label="Elliott Haut" data-sort="HautElliott">Haut</span> was asked to oversee efforts to improve the <span class="mention organization" id="mention-20" about="Johns Hopkins Hospital" data-wikidata-id="Q1472068" data-label="Johns Hopkins Hospital">Hopkins</span> trauma department. The goal was to create better outcomes for the patients by improving the performance of the <span class="keyword" id="keyword-45" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">doctors</span>. When <span id="mention-21" class="mention person" about="Elliott Haut" data-label="Elliott Haut" data-sort="HautElliott">Haut</span> dived into the <span class="keyword" id="keyword-46" about="hospital" data-label="hospital" data-sort="hospital">hospital</span>’s data, he found that patients were developing blood clots at a strikingly high rate.

<p><span class="wmf-wp-with-preview" data-wikipedia-preview>Blood clots</span> – the condition that threatened <span id="mention-22" class="mention person" about="Serena Williams" data-label="Serena Williams" data-sort="WilliamsSerena" data-wikidata-id="Q11459">Serena Williams</span>’s life when she was in the <span class="keyword" id="keyword-47" about="hospital" data-label="hospital" data-sort="hospital">hospital</span> giving birth – are gelatinous globs of stuck-together blood cells that can travel through blood vessels and block blood flow to the lungs. They kill about 100,000 people a year in the <span id="mention-23" class="mention place" about="United States of America" data-label="United States of America" data-wikidata-id="Q30">US</span> – more than breast cancer, Aids and car crashes combined. Many of these clots are preventable, if  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-48" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">doctors</span> prescribe the right clot prevention. In some cases, this means blood thinners; in others, mechanical "squeezy" boots that inflate and deflate around the legs to get the blood moving. But at <span class="mention organization" id="mention-24" about="Johns Hopkins Hospital" data-wikidata-id="Q1472068" data-label="Johns Hopkins Hospital">Hopkins</span>, only a third of the highest-risk patients were getting the right blood-clot prevention, <span id="mention-25" class="mention person" about="Elliott Haut" data-label="Elliott Haut" data-sort="HautElliott">Haut</span> found. “We’d get a patient into surgery – a routine surgery – and a week later they’d die of a pulmonary embolism,” he told me as we sat in his office in east Baltimore, near a pile of wooden puzzles. And this problem wasn’t specific to <span class="mention organization" id="mention-26" about="Johns Hopkins Hospital" data-wikidata-id="Q1472068" data-label="Johns Hopkins Hospital">Hopkins</span>: at <span class="keyword" id="keyword-49" about="hospital" data-label="hospital" data-sort="hospital">hospitals</span> around the country, patients were getting proper clot prevention only about 40% of the time – a problem that the <span class="mention organization" id="mention-27" about="American Public Health Association" data-wikidata-id="Q4744758" data-label="American Public Health Association">American Public  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-50" about="health" data-label="health" data-sort="health">Health</span> Association</span> was calling a crisis.</p>

<p><span id="mention-28" class="mention person" about="Elliott Haut" data-label="Elliott Haut" data-sort="HautElliott">Haut</span> wasn’t sure why  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-51" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">doctors</span> were failing to prescribe the right interventions. Maybe, he thought, they overestimated the risks of blood-clot prevention because patients who had developed complications from blood thinners sprang to memory more easily than those who were treated successfully. <span id="mention-29" class="mention person" about="Elliott Haut" data-label="Elliott Haut" data-sort="HautElliott">Haut</span> wasn’t thinking about disparities; his goal was to improve clot prevention for everyone.</p>

<p>To do so, <span id="mention-30" class="mention person" about="Elliott Haut" data-label="Elliott Haut" data-sort="HautElliott">Haut</span> and his team sought out an approach that had been developed by <span id="mention-31" class="mention person" about="Peter Pronovost" data-label="Peter Pronovost" data-sort="PronovostPeter">Peter Pronovost</span>, another <span class="mention organization" id="mention-32" about="Johns Hopkins Hospital" data-wikidata-id="Q1472068" data-label="Johns Hopkins Hospital">Hopkins</span> <span class="keyword" id="keyword-52" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">doctor</span>, whose own father had died because of a cancer misdiagnosis. <span id="mention-33" class="mention person" about="Peter Pronovost" data-label="Peter Pronovost" data-sort="PronovostPeter">Pronovost</span> had formulated a technique for improving medical care by adapting an approach used in aviation: the humble checklist. A checklist is just what it sounds like – a reminder of all the mandated steps a clinician should take. It plugs memory holes and hangs a safety net under human errors so they don’t add up. Proper <span class="wmf-wp-with-preview" data-wikipedia-preview data-wp-title="Intensive care unit">ICU care</span>, for instance, requires nearly 200 separate actions each day. Complications can arise from missing even one or two.</p>

<p><span id="mention-34" class="mention person" about="Peter Pronovost" data-label="Peter Pronovost" data-sort="PronovostPeter">Pronovost</span> showed that using a checklist in intensive care units reduced infections simply by ensuring that  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-53" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">doctors</span> adhere, each time, to a predetermined set of tasks. In one trial, a five-step checklist reminding workers in more than 100 ICUs to do things such as washing their hands and cleaning the patient’s skin with antiseptic led to a 66% drop in catheter-related bloodstream infections. The drop held steady over the 18 months of the study.</p>

<p><span id="mention-35" class="mention person" about="Elliott Haut" data-label="Elliott Haut" data-sort="HautElliott">Haut</span> and his team decided to try developing a checklist for blood-clot prevention. In their version, whenever a  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-54" about="health" data-label="health" data-sort="health">healthcare</span> provider admitted a patient to the <span class="keyword" id="keyword-55" about="hospital" data-label="hospital" data-sort="hospital">hospital</span>, a computerised checklist would pop up on screen. The checklist would walk the  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-56" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">doctor</span> step by step through risk factors for blood clots and for bleeding from blood-thinning medication. After the checklist was complete, the system would suggest a recommended treatment – a blood thinner, for instance, or a mechanical squeezy boot to move the blood. If  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-57" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">doctors</span> didn’t choose the suggested treatment, they had to document their reasons.</p>

<p>The approach worked. After introducing the checklist, the percentage of patients getting the right clot prevention surged, and preventable clots in trauma and internal medicine were close to eliminated. One study of a month of <span class="keyword" id="keyword-58" about="hospital" data-label="hospital" data-sort="hospital">hospital</span> admissions found that the number of internal medicine patients who returned to the <span class="keyword" id="keyword-59" about="hospital" data-label="hospital" data-sort="hospital">hospital</span> with blood clots within 90 days of discharge fell from 20 to two. And after the introduction of the checklist, the rate of fatal pulmonary embolism was cut in half.</p>

<p>That could have been the end of the story. But <span id="mention-36" class="mention person" about="Elliott Haut" data-label="Elliott Haut" data-sort="HautElliott">Haut</span>’s office was, at the time, two doors down from the office of <span id="mention-37" class="mention person" about="Adil Haider" data-label="Adil Haider" data-sort="HaiderAdil">Adil Haider</span>, a  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-60" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">doctor</span> who studies gender and racial disparities in  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-61" about="health" data-label="health" data-sort="health">health</span> care. Their conversations prompted <span id="mention-38" class="mention person" about="Elliott Haut" data-label="Elliott Haut" data-sort="HautElliott">Haut</span> to wonder whether there had been disparities in blood-clot prevention. The team hadn’t sliced the data that way, but when they went back over the numbers, an alarming pattern appeared. While 31% of male trauma patients had failed to get treatment, the rate was 45% for women. In other words, women had been nearly 50% more likely to miss out on blood-clot prevention than men, and in greater danger of dying of this particular cause.</p>

<p>It’s possible that factors other than gender might have been at play. Most patients who arrive with gunshot wounds, for instance, are men; perhaps  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-62" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">doctors</span> prescribed more prevention for more severe injuries. But as the <span class="keyword" id="keyword-63" about="research" data-label="research" data-sort="research">researcher</span> who analysed the data put it, the disparities in treatment fit a consistent, large and well established pattern of women receiving suboptimal care.</p>

<p>Looking at the numbers after the checklist was introduced,<span id="mention-39" class="mention person" about="Elliott Haut" data-label="Elliott Haut" data-sort="HautElliott"> Haut</span> and the team found that it had eliminated the gender disparities. Women and men received the right clot prevention at exactly the same rates. The gap had disappeared.</p>

<p class="big-first-letter">In 2008, the <span class="mention organization" id="mention-40" about="University of Chicago" data-wikidata-id="Q131252" data-label="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</span> economist <span id="mention-41" class="mention person" about="Richard Thaler" data-label="Richard Thaler" data-sort="ThalerRichard">Richard Thaler</span> and the legal scholar <span id="mention-42" class="mention person" about="Cass Sunstein" data-label="Cass Sunstein" data-sort="SunsteinCass">Cass Sunstein</span>, co-authors of Nudge: Improving Decisions about  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-64" about="health" data-label="health" data-sort="health">Health</span>, Wealth, and Happiness, coined the term "choice architecture" to describe a powerful phenomenon: the context within which we make a choice has a profound influence on the way we choose. Just as the design of a physical environment can influence our behaviour (as seen in coffee shops that skimp on electric outlets to discourage people from sitting with laptops), the design of a process can also shape our behaviour. It, too, can be thought of as a kind of architecture.</p>

<p>For instance, <span class="keyword" id="keyword-65" about="research" data-label="research" data-sort="research">researchers</span> at the <span class="mention organization" id="mention-43" about="University of Minnesota" data-wikidata-id="Q238101" data-label="University of Minnesota">University of Minnesota</span> discovered that they could coax students into eating more vegetables simply by redesigning their lunchtime routine. In a typical lunch line, students encounter carrots next to more tempting options such as fries and pizza. Instead, the <span class="keyword" id="keyword-66" about="research" data-label="research" data-sort="research">researchers</span> gave kids a cup of carrots the moment they arrived in the cafeteria, when they were at their most hungry. It worked: kids ate a lot more carrots. The key was to put the carrots "in a competition they actually can win" – a contest not against fries, but against being really hungry. To change how students ate, it wasn’t necessary to sell them on the virtues of vitamin A. What changed was the choice architecture.</p>

<p>The <span class="mention organization" id="mention-44" about="Johns Hopkins Hospital" data-wikidata-id="Q1472068" data-label="Johns Hopkins Hospital">Hopkins</span> checklist is a kind of choice architecture, too – a way of shaping a  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-67" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">doctor</span>’s behaviour not through persuasion, but through design. It doesn’t ask  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-68" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">doctors</span> to think more carefully about their biases; it simply interrupts the process by which they make decisions. The <<span class="mention organization" id="mention-45" about="Johns Hopkins Hospital" data-wikidata-id="Q1472068" data-label="Johns Hopkins Hospital">Hopkins</span> checklist forces  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-69" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">doctors</span> to disentangle the thinking that goes into a medical decision. In a way, it acts like a prism, reverse-engineering a holistic judgment into its constituent parts, the way a prism separates white light into its rainbow colours.</p>

<p>The checklist also supports that human judgment. It is meant to remind  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-70" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">doctors</span> of steps they might forget, but bias isn’t really about forgetting. It’s about using assumptions to judge and evaluate, without necessarily being aware of the presence of those assumptions. Some  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-71" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">doctors</span> resist the intrusion, pointing out that these mandated checklists aren’t perfect. As one <span class="keyword" id="keyword-72" about="hospital" data-label="hospital" data-sort="hospital">hospitalist</span> told me, they may not take into account the full range of factors a  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-73" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">doctor</span> might consider. While a clot checklist asks questions to assess risk at one moment in time, an experienced  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-74" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">doctor</span> might note that a patient with pain could have a procedure tomorrow that could change the risk profile over time. The checklist does not have the capacity to account for this nuance. As the medical scenarios become more complex, the checklist may be best considered a failsafe for decision-making, not a substitute.</p>

<p>But checklists have been shown to reduce bias elsewhere. After a structured decision-making tool was introduced in the state of Illinois, the disparities between psychiatric <span class="keyword" id="keyword-75" about="hospital" data-label="hospital" data-sort="hospital">hospitalisation</span> of young, low-risk Hispanic and Black patients and white patients shrank. When the <span class="mention organization" id="mention-46" about="Mayo Clinic" data-wikidata-id="Q1130172" data-label="Mayo Clinic">Mayo Clinic</span> instituted a system of automatic referrals for cardiac rehabilitation after heart attacks, the gender gap between men’s and women’s referral rates disappeared.</p>

<p>Using principles of behavioural design to reduce bias dates back to 1952, when the <span class="mention organization" id="mention-47" about="Boston Symphony Orchestra" data-wikidata-id="Q864369" data-label="Boston Symphony Orchestra"><span class="wmf-wp-with-preview" data-wikipedia-preview>Boston Symphony Orchestra</span></span> began changing the way it auditioned musicians. Instead of having musicians play in full view of a panel of judges, a screen was set up to divide them. Women musicians were asked to remove their shoes, so clacking high heels wouldn’t be a tell. Instead, a man standing onstage created fake footsteps with his shoes.</p>

<p>In the following decades, curtained auditions rippled through American orchestras – a heavy cloth was hung from the ceiling, or a room divider was stretched like an accordion across the stage. By the 90s, most had adopted the practice. When the economists <span id="mention-48" class="mention person" about="Claudia Goldin" data-label="Claudia Goldin" data-sort="GoldinClaudia">Claudia Goldin</span> and <span id="mention-49" class="mention person" about="Cecilia Rouse" data-label="Cecilia Rouse" data-sort="RouseCecilia">Cecilia Rouse</span> studied the differences between orchestras that did and did not use this approach, they found stark evidence that masking gender changed judges’ assessment of women’s skills. They found that concealing musicians’ identities increased women’s odds of advancing to the next round of auditions by 50%. Today, women make up almost 40% of orchestras.</p>

<p>Relying on a blunt tool like blurring out a person’s <span class="keyword" id="keyword-76" about="society" data-label="society" data-sort="society">social</span> identity is problematic, and can veer toward erasure, which is itself a form of discrimination. But in the case of a hiring decision, it can also shield a person’s evaluation from harmful stereotyping – or unfair advantages.</p>

<div class="lastPar">
    <div class="endSx" id="rl1_2"></div>
    <div class="endDx" id="rr1_2"></div>
<p>Of course, the masked approach isn’t possible in medicine, which usually depends on face-to-face interactions between  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-77" about="doctor" data-label="doctor" data-sort="doctor">doctor</span> and patient. Structured decision-making tools such as checklists is a close cousin. These steer people in positions of power from using assumptions and preconceptions, so they rely instead on official criteria. That alone can unleash powerful changes.</p>

<p class="big-first-letter">Pronouns are giving us trouble.</p>
<p><span class="mention language" id="mention-3" about="English" data-label="English" data-sort="English">English</span> speakers face a dilemma. The current structure of our language is exclusionary with regard to  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-2" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span>: The personal pronouns “she” and “he” don’t represent all the ways people see themselves. Having only these two options excludes trans individuals, those who identify as nonbinary, and others who don’t identify as female or male.
</p>
<p class="big-first-letter">One popular current solution is to express preferred personal pronouns: Someone explains, verbally or in <span class="keyword" id="keyword-3" about="writing" data-label="writing" data-sort="writing">writing</span>, a preference for <u>she</u>, <u>he</u>, <u>they</u>, and so on (for clarity, I’ll underline the pronouns discussed in this piece). This is a vast improvement over nondeclaration, but it has limitations. Personalized  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-4" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> pronouns don’t fundamentally challenge  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-5" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> exclusion; in some respects, they further it.
</p>
<p>The more radically inclusive option is to eliminate preferred personal pronouns (including <u>she</u> and <u>he</u>) in favor of a nongendered or <span class="keyword" id="keyword-6" about="epicenity" data-label="epicene" data-sort="epicene">epicene</span> pronoun (the word “<span class="keyword" id="keyword-7" about="epicenity" data-label="epicene" data-sort="epicene">epicene</span>” comes from a root meaning “common”). An <span class="keyword" id="keyword-8" about="epicenity" data-label="epicene" data-sort="epicene">epicene</span> pronoun doesn’t mark  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-9" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span>. For instance, in <span class="mention language" id="mention-4" about="English" data-label="English" data-sort="English">English</span> <u>you</u> isn’t a feminine or masculine pronoun; it’s an <span class="keyword" id="keyword-10" about="epicenity" data-label="epicene" data-sort="epicene">epicene</span> pronoun. I think the best replacement for <u>he</u> and <u>she</u> is <u>they</u>.
</p>
<p>To be clear, I’m proposing turning <span class="mention language" id="mention-5" about="English" data-label="English" data-sort="English">English</span> into an <span class="keyword" id="keyword-11" about="epicenity" data-label="epicene" data-sort="epicene">epicene</span> language, altering it structurally, at its “root,” rather than tweaking the “leaves” of individual speakers. This would mean scrapping <u>he</u> and <u>she</u> altogether in favor of <u>they</u>, rather than picking and choosing based on circumstance or preference.
</p>
<p>This might sound difficult. But there are plenty of other languages that already do this. <span class="mention language" id="mention-6" about="English" data-label="English" data-sort="English">English</span> itself has made similar alterations in the past, and there are signs that the shift is already happening without anyone particularly noticing or complaining. <span class="mention language" id="mention-7" about="English" data-label="English" data-sort="English">English</span> is actually very nearly  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-12" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> neutral. All it needs is one final push to get it over the line.
</p>
<p>Language isn’t just a set of labels to identify things: It shapes how we see the world and is a way of acting in the world. Nor is it static: It changes with shifting times. We must now intentionally transform <span class="mention language" id="mention-8" about="English" data-label="English" data-sort="English">English</span> to make it  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-13" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> inclusive.
</p>
<hr/>
<p class="big-first-letter">As a queer and linguistic anthropologist, I’m inspired by <span class="keyword" id="keyword-14" about="society" data-label="society" data-sort="society">social</span> movements, from <span class="wmf-wp-with-preview" data-wikipedia-preview>feminism</span> to <span class="wmf-wp-with-preview" data-wikipedia-preview>disability justice</span>, that have changed language for everyone.
</p>
<p>The word Latinx, for example, emerged in the <span class="mention language" id="mention-9" about="English" data-label="English" data-sort="English">English</span> language around 2004 as a  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-15" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span>-neutral replacement for the Spanish “Latino” and “Latina.” “Chairman” has become “chairperson.” The word “disabled” is now preferred over historical terms such as “crippled.” These shifts have not generally been seen as a matter of individual preference but rather a pervasive language change, even if the specific words used are contested.
</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote mx-3">Read on, from the archives: “<a href="https://www.sapiens.org/archaeology/transgender-people-exist-in-history/" target="_blank">Stop Erasing Transgender Stories From History</a>”
</blockquote>s
<p>I also draw inspiration from other cultures and languages. The breadth of ways in which pronouns differ from one language to another shows that a lot of things <span class="mention language" id="mention-10" about="English" data-label="English" data-sort="English">English</span> speakers might take for granted aren’t necessarily the only way of doing things.
</p>
<p>All languages have first-person, second-person, and third-person pronouns (like <u>I</u>, <u>you</u>, and <u>she</u>). And all languages distinguish between some singular and plural pronouns (like <u>I</u> versus <u>we</u>)—but not always all of them everywhere in the language. For example, <span class="mention language" id="mention-11" about="English" data-label="English" data-sort="English">English</span> doesn’t mark singular versus plural in the second-person pronoun: We use <u>you</u> to refer to one person or several people, regardless of number or  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-16" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span>.
</p>
<p>But not all aspects of personal pronouns are universal. Some languages have a “dual” pronoun specifically for two people. For instance, in <span class="mention language" id="mention-12" about="Hawaiian" data-label="Hawaiian" data-sort="Hawaiian">Hawaiian</span> <em><u>‘oe</u></em> means <u>you</u> spoken to one person (singular), <em><u>‘oukou</u></em> means <u>you</u> spoken to three or more people (plural), and <em><u>‘olua</u></em> means <em><u>you</u></em> spoken to exactly two people (dual).

<div class="imgFrame"></div>
<p class="imgCaption">In Swedish, the  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-17" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span>-neutral “hen” is increasingly used instead of their equivalents for “he” and “she.”
</p>
<hr>
<p>Languages can have distinct “inclusive” and “exclusive” third-person plural pronouns. If I was at <span id="mention-13" class="mention person" about="George" data-label="George" data-sort="George">George</span>’s house with <span id="mention-14" class="mention person" about="Asya" data-label="Asya" data-sort="Asya">Asya</span> and <span id="mention-15" class="mention person" about="Kim" data-label="Kim" data-sort="Kim">Kim</span>, and wanted all four of us to shop, I’d tell <span id="mention-16" class="mention person" about="George" data-label="George" data-sort="George">George</span>, “<u>We</u> should go to the store.” If I wanted to shop with <span id="mention-17" class="mention person" about="Asya" data-label="Asya" data-sort="Asya">Asya</span> and <span id="mention-18" class="mention person" about="Kim" data-label="Kim" data-sort="Kim">Kim</span> but thought <span id="mention-19" class="mention person" about="George" data-label="George" data-sort="George">George</span> should stay home, I’d also tell <span id="mention-20" class="mention person" about="George" data-label="George" data-sort="George">George</span>, “<u>We</u> should go to the store.” In <span class="mention language" id="mention-21" about="Indonesian" data-label="Indonesian" data-sort="Indonesian">Indonesian</span> (which I speak), I’d use the inclusive pronoun <em><u>kita</u></em> in the first instance but the exclusive pronoun <em><u>kami</u></em> in the second.
</p>
<p>Informal versus formal status is sometimes marked on personal pronouns, like <em><u>tu/vous</u></em> in French, or <em><u>du/Sie</u></em> in German. In <span class="mention language" id="mention-22" about="English" data-label="English" data-sort="English">English</span>, we can mark <span class="keyword" id="keyword-18" about="society" data-label="society" data-sort="society">social</span> status with words like “Sir” or “Madam,” but we can also avoid it with you: If you met a celebrity, you would say, “Nice to meet <u>you</u>,” using the same pronoun as when telling a child, “I love <u>you</u>.”
</p>
<p>None of these three examples of personal pronoun features are universal; <span class="mention language" id="mention-23" about="English" data-label="English" data-sort="English">English</span> works fine without them.
</p>
<p>History plays a role. In <span class="mention language" id="mention-24" about="English" data-label="English" data-sort="English">English</span>, there used to be a distinction between <u>thou</u> and <u>you</u> as singular versus plural pronouns. Through a historical process, <u>you</u> additionally became honorific, and <u>thou</u> came to imply lower status: Challenges to class hierarchy led to the loss of <u>thou</u> (save a few specialized uses). You replaced thou as the singular second-person pronoun while keeping its plural meaning: That’s why we use a plural verb even when telling one person, “<u>You</u> are late”—not “<u>You</u> is late.”
</p>
<p class="big-first-letter">Gendered pronouns, too, aren’t universal. This is absolutely pivotal. If something is linguistically universal, getting rid of it is likely impossible. It’s hard to imagine a language without a first-person pronoun like <u>I</u>, for example. But if something doesn’t appear in some languages, that proves it’s not obligatory for cognition and communication.
</p>
<p>Many languages already have no <span class="keyword" id="keyword-19" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gendered</span> pronouns. For instance, in <span class="mention language" id="mention-25" about="Indonesian" data-label="Indonesian" data-sort="Indonesian">Indonesian</span>, <em><u>dia</u></em> refers to men, women, and trans people. There’s no equivalent to <u>she</u> or <u>he</u> at all. Other examples of what I call “<span class="keyword" id="keyword-20" about="epicenity" data-label="epicene" data-sort="epicene">epicene</span> languages” include <span class="mention language" id="mention-26" about="Chinese" data-label="Chinese" data-sort="Chinese">Chinese</span>, <span class="mention language" id="mention-27" about="Finnish" data-label="Finnish" data-sort="Finnish">Finnish</span>, <span class="mention language" id="mention-28" about="Japanese" data-label="Japanese" data-sort="Japanese">Japanese</span>, <span class="mention language" id="mention-29" about="Korean" data-label="Korean" data-sort="Korean">Korean</span>, <span class="mention language" id="mention-30" about="Persian" data-label="Persian" data-sort="Persian">Persian</span>, and <span class="mention language" id="mention-31" about="Turkish" data-label="Turkish" data-sort="Turkish">Turkish</span>. Around 1.5 billion people speak <span class="keyword" id="keyword-21" about="epicenity" data-label="epicene" data-sort="epicene">epicene</span> languages every day.
</p>
<p>Some languages are <em>more</em> <span class="keyword" id="keyword-22" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gendered</span> than <span class="mention language" id="mention-32" about="English" data-label="English" data-sort="English">English</span>, marking  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-23" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> on nouns and adjectives: for example, Spanish and French. A few even mark  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-24" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> on verbs—for instance, the past tense in Russian. Fortunately, <span class="mention language" id="mention-33" about="English" data-label="English" data-sort="English">English</span> is already <span class="keyword" id="keyword-25" about="epicenity" data-label="epicene" data-sort="epicene">epicene</span> with regard to nouns, verbs, and adjectives; all that remains is to extend this to pronouns. Still more fortunately, <span class="mention language" id="mention-34" about="English" data-label="English" data-sort="English">English</span> pronouns are already <span class="keyword" id="keyword-26" about="epicenity" data-label="epicene" data-sort="epicene">epicene</span> in the first person (<u>I</u>), second person (<u>you</u>), and plural third person (<u>they</u>).
</p>
<aside>Some complain that they is plural, but we have no trouble with you as both a singular and plural pronoun.</aside>
<p>
<span class="mention language" id="mention-35" about="English" data-label="English" data-sort="English">English</span> speakers have been using <span class="keyword" id="keyword-27" about="epicenity" data-label="epicene" data-sort="epicene">epicene</span> <u>they</u> as a stand-in for <u>he/she</u> <a href="https://public.oed.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-singular-they/" target="_blank">since the 1300s</a>—in everyday speech and in literature from <span class="wmf-wp-with-preview" data-wikipedia-preview><span class="mention person" id="mention-36" about="Jane Austen" data-label="Jane Austen" data-sort="AustenJane">Jane Austen</span></span> to <span class="wmf-wp-with-preview" data-wikipedia-preview><span class="mention person" id="mention-37" about="William Shakespeare" data-label="William Shakespeare" data-sort="ShakespeareWilliam">William Shakespeare</span></span>: “There’s not a man I meet but doth salute me as if I were <u>their</u> well-acquainted friend.”
</p>
<p>Every <span class="mention language" id="mention-38" about="English" data-label="English" data-sort="English">English</span> speaker reading this already uses <span class="keyword" id="keyword-28" about="epicenity" data-label="epicene" data-sort="epicene">epicene</span> <u>they</u>, usually without realizing it (indeed, even if they think it’s wrong), and despite the discouragement of educational systems, in utterances such as “somebody left <u>their</u> coat in the room.” There’s strong evidence that <span class="keyword" id="keyword-29" about="epicenity" data-label="epicene" data-sort="epicene">epicene</span> <u>they</u> is already displacing sexist generic he (which encodes patriarchy) and phrases like <u>she or he</u> (which encodes  <span class="wmf-wp-with-preview" data-wikipedia-preview><span class="keyword" id="keyword-30" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> binarism</span>).
</p>
<p>In recent decades, the use of <span class="keyword" id="keyword-31" about="epicenity" data-label="epicene" data-sort="epicene">epicene</span> <u>they</u> <a href="https://www.glossa-journal.org/article/id/4942/" target="_blank">has been increasing</a> in scholarly publications and everyday speech—even when the person mentioned has a known binary  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-32" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span>, as in “Professor Jones said <u>they</u> canceled the test.” In 2019, the <span class="wmf-wp-with-preview" data-wikipedia-preview>American Dialect Society</span> voted <span class="keyword" id="keyword-33" about="epicenity" data-label="epicene" data-sort="epicene">epicene</span> <u>they</u> “<a href="https://www.americandialect.org/2019-word-of-the-year-is-my-pronouns-word-of-the-decade-is-singular-they" target="_blank">Word of the Decade</a>”; that same year, the <span class="wmf-wp-with-preview" data-wikipedia-preview>Merriam-Webster Dictionary</span> recognized <span class="keyword" id="keyword-34" about="epicenity" data-label="epicene" data-sort="epicene">epicene</span> they. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/14/janelle-monae-non-binary-pronouns-they-them" target="_blank">Many</a><a href="http://feministing.com/2015/02/03/how-using-they-as-a-singular-pronoun-can-change-the-world/" target="_blank"> contemporary</a> queer, trans, and feminist scholars, activists, and allies have <a href="https://www.alwd.org/lcr-archives/fall-2020-volume-17/575-get-with-the-pronoun" target="_blank">also called for</a> <span class="keyword" id="keyword-35" about="epicenity" data-label="epicene" data-sort="epicene">epicene</span> <u>they</u>.
</p>
<p class="first-big-letter">Of course, <u>they</u> isn’t the only option for a  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-36" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span>-neutral third-person singular pronoun, and it doesn’t come without issues.
</p>
<p>Some claim <span class="keyword" id="keyword-37" about="epicenity" data-label="epicene" data-sort="epicene">epicene</span> <u>they</u> is incorrect because <u>they</u> is plural, but we have no trouble with <u>you</u> as both a singular and plural pronoun.
</p>
<p>From a feminist perspective, one possible concern is that <span class="keyword" id="keyword-38" about="epicenity" data-label="epicene" data-sort="epicene">epicene</span> <u>they</u> could become a new masculine generic pronoun, erasing the impact that can be made by using <u>she</u> as a generic term instead of he. However, generic <u>she</u> hasn’t been inclusive for many people (such as many queer women, Black women, and others historically excluded from full womanhood).
</p>
<p>Many people (including but not limited to trans people) feel a need to choose their pronouns. For over a century, this has sometimes included inventing new words entirely: neo-pronouns like <u>em</u> or <u>ve</u>. I’d ask such people to consider how this need is shaped by language itself. Why is there no desire for personalized <u>you</u> or <u>I</u> pronouns, for example? This is an <span class="mention language" id="mention-39" about="English" data-label="English" data-sort="English">English</span>-centric feeling. Were you speaking <span class="mention language" id="mention-40" about="Indonesian" data-label="Indonesian" data-sort="Indonesian">Indonesian</span>, Turkish, or Chinese, you wouldn’t feel a need to choose  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-39" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gendered</span> personal pronouns because such pronouns don’t exist. The issue isn’t self-expression but where in language that self-expression takes place.

<p class="imgCaption">The phrase “he or she” encodes a binary view of  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-40" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> that excludes nonbinary people. 
<hr>
<p>Sometimes the act of expressing a pronoun preference or asking for preferences is a way for someone to firmly indicate that they support  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-41" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> inclusion. This is sometimes dismissed as virtue signaling, but it can be an important way to disrupt norms. This disruption is important; the question, again, is where in language that disruption best takes place.
</p>
<p>Personalized <span class="keyword" id="keyword-42" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> pronouns require stating one’s preferences over and over again. They provide no help when referring to people we haven’t met; misgendering and its accompanying trauma are still very possible. Note how in <span class="mention language" id="mention-41" about="English" data-label="English" data-sort="English">English</span>, the negative consequences of misgendering never occur when using first-person or second-person pronouns, because <u>I</u> and <u>you</u> are already <span class="keyword" id="keyword-43" about="epicenity" data-label="epicene" data-sort="epicene">epicene</span>.
</p>
<p>The whole point of pronouns is that they categorize: They group people together. Remembering many personalized  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-44" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> pronouns is hard and can be ableist with regard to those with cognitive differences.
</p>
<p>Radical <span class="keyword" id="keyword-45" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> inclusion demands completing the historical transformation of <span class="mention language" id="mention-42" about="English" data-label="English" data-sort="English">English</span> into an <span class="keyword" id="keyword-46" about="epicenity" data-label="epicene" data-sort="epicene">epicene</span> language by eliminating, not increasing, the marking of  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-47" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span>.
</p>
<p class="big-first-letter">If we’re interested in eliminating structural oppression, then structural change is necessary.
</p>
<p>This idea has been pivotal to other <span class="keyword" id="keyword-48" about="society" data-label="society" data-sort="society">social</span> justice movements. Racism, for instance, is recognized as not just the result of individual racist feelings but the structural consequence of a system of <span class="keyword" id="keyword-49" about="society" data-label="society" data-sort="society">social</span> relationships embedded in power and history. Similarly, heterosexism isn’t just the result of individual feelings of homophobia: It’s the structural consequence of a system of <span class="keyword" id="keyword-50" about="society" data-label="society" data-sort="society">social</span> relationships that legitimates only some forms of desire.  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-51" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> exclusion in language is also structural and requires a structural change to <span class="mention language" id="mention-43" about="English" data-label="English" data-sort="English">English</span> to address it.
</p>
<p>Given that <span class="mention language" id="mention-44" about="English" data-label="English" data-sort="English">English</span> is already almost <span class="keyword" id="keyword-52" about="epicenity" data-label="epicene" data-sort="epicene">epicene</span>, the change is comparatively easy. The change has been possible in languages with more pervasive  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-53" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> pronouns: In Swedish, for instance, since 2012, <a href="https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/swedish-hen" target="_blank">the Finnish pronoun</a> <em><u>hän</u></em> (<span class="keyword" id="keyword-54" about="epicenity" data-label="epicene" data-sort="epicene">epicene</span> <u>they</u>; Finnish has no <u>he</u> or <u>she</u>) has inspired the Swedish <em><u>hen</u></em> to replace <u>she</u> (<em><u>hon</u></em>) and <u>he</u> (<em><u>han</u></em>).
</p>
<p>Linguistic inclusion doesn’t automatically mean <span class="keyword" id="keyword-55" about="society" data-label="society" data-sort="society">social</span> inclusion: The fact that we use “humankind” instead of “mankind” doesn’t mean sexism no longer exists. But <a href="https://www.sapiens.org/language/dictionary-prejudice/" target="_blank">language does shape thought</a>—in a sense, it constitutes thought, shaping our assumptions about the world and influencing how we act in everyday life.
</p>
<p>Giving up she and he might seem painful. But at one point, thou was equally well-known; over time, it was eliminated without detriment. I ask <span class="mention language" id="mention-45" about="English" data-label="English" data-sort="English">English</span>-speaking cisgendered allies to give up <u>she</u> and <u>he</u> in the name of radical  <span class="keyword" id="keyword-56" about="gender" data-label="gender" data-sort="gender">gender</span> inclusion.
</p>
<p>I look forward to the day when <u>she</u> and <u>he</u> are like <u>thou</u>: archaic pronouns recognized in old texts but no longer in common use. There is a path out of this pronoun trouble.</p>

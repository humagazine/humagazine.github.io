llll | DHDK's Vitali Project

hUmagazine is an online periodical inspired by topics dear to gender studies. The choices that have been made both in the back-end and in the front-end aim to reflect its philosophy and intentions.
The resource collects issues organized in thematic magazines and enriched with meaningful metadata for active use of the content

This project has been realized during the University of Bologna course in Information Modeling and Web Technologies held by Professor Fabio Vitali in the y.a. 2020-2021. The website is built and managed by two students, Diego Chillo and Laura Travaglini, attending the course.
